## Short description
Lightning-fast penny auctions powered by Yellow Network state channels.

## Description
This project is a live penny-auction experience built for the Yellow Network. Users connect a wallet, open a state-channel session, and place rapid bids without waiting for on-chain confirmations. Each $1 bid raises the price by $0.01 and resets the timer. When the timer hits zero, the last bidder wins and pays the final price; the seller keeps all bid fees. Buyers can win premium items for far less than retail, while sellers benefit from higher engagement and revenue through competitive bidding. Yellow Network state channels and app sessions keep every bid signed, verified, and confirmed in real time for instant, secure settlement.
